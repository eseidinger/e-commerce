# E-Commerce JSF

## Initial Application

Let Copilot generate:

- a data model for an arbitrary e-commerce application
- a Jakarta 10 application with JSF frontend and JPA entities to perform basic CRUD operations that runs on Payara Micro
- a Docker environment with PostgreSQL

What needed fixing:

- Dependency versions
- Package names
- Data source configuration
- Column references
- Transaction handling
- JSF forms
